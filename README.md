The lecture notes (including presentations) are provided in the folder `notes-presentations`.

## Requirements

It is assumed that you have installed 

 1. the latest version of R and Rstudio
 2. the latest version of the R package `tinytex`. Otherwise install it using the following R lines.

## Quiz Template: How to Use



 1. Open the folder `quiz-template/`
 2. Double-click the `quiz-template.Rproj`. (This will open an RStudio where you will edit the template).
 3. (IMPORTANT!) Create a copy of `stt133-quiz1-surname-firstname.Rmd` with replacing the `surname` with your surname and `firstname` with your first name.
 4. Double-click this new copy to open in the RStudio editor.
 5. You can now start editing.
 6. Click the `Knit` button in RStudio or, equivalently, press `Cntrl + Shift + K` for Windows or `Command + Shift + K` for Mac to build/render the pdf output.
 6. NEVER EDIT the `quiz-template.tex` file.
